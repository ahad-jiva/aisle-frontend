# AI.sle Frontend

Simple frontend for AI.sle demo. Built with React + TS + Vite.

## Usage
Clone the repo, then run
```bash
npm i
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be available at `localhost`. Check terminal output for exact port/link.

The frontend interface pings the backend server every 5 seconds to check if it is available. Make sure the backend is running on port `8000`.
